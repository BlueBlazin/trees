## A collection of tree datastructures implemented in python.

Detailed explanations of each data-structure and its implementation at: (COMING SOON)


### Trees:

- Binary Search Tree
- Min-heap
- Trie
- Red black tree
- AVL tree
- Splay tree
- van Emde Boas tree
- B-Tree


### Notes:

- The code contains very few comments, mainly for two reasons. 
- 1. First, all names of functions and variables are expressive enough that the code should be understandable even without comments. 
- 2. Second, the implementation of each data-structure is explained in detail in the blog post.
- There are no safety checks or assertions in the code. I assume you already know how to implement those. The purpose of this code is to show how the data-structures themselves can be implemented in python.
