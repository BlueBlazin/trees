## A collection of tree datastructures implemented in python.

Detailed explanations of each data-structure and its implementation at: (COMING SOON)


### Trees:

- Binary Search Tree
- Min-heap
- Trie
- Red black tree
- AVL tree


### Notes:

The code contains very few comments, mainly for two reasons. 
- First, the various names are expressive enough that the code should be understandable even without comments. 
- Second, the implementation of each data-structure is explained in detail in the blog post.
